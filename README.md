Work done for refactoring:
Firstly, I have changed some method name to something that is much more easier to understand
such as playerBarMoveLeft or playerBarMoveTo.
Besides that, I have also delete a few method that is redundant such as setSpeed, this is because
setSpeedX and setSpeedY will be able to do the same as setSpeed.
Furthermore, I have also added a few method to be able to reuse the same code rather than 
making a big chunk of codes that is messy.
Not only that, I have also do encapsulation for public variables. I have also refactor the bricks by using design pattern.
Having a BrickFactory to be able to call which brick is needed. I have also organise the code by MVC in InstructionModel class,
InstructionView class and InstructionController class which will be shown when user clicks on the Instruction Button.

Work done for addition:
